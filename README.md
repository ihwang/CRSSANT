# CRSSANT: Computational RNA Secondary Structure Analysis using Network Techniques

CRSSANT is an analysis pipeline for sequencing data that were produced using the PARIS assay described in [Lu et al., Cell 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867416304226). CRSSANT automates the process of grouping sequencing reads into duplex groups (DGs), and tests the DGs to find potential secondary structures.
